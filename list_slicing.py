# Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing

# Creating a list of numbers from 1 to 10
numbers = list(range(1, 11))

# Extracting the first five elements
first_five = numbers[:5]

# Reversing the extracted elements
reversed_list = first_five[::-1]

# Printing the results
print("Extracted first five elements:", first_five)
print("Reversed extracted list:", reversed_list)
